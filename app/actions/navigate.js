	This function is called when a change of path occurs. It is also called on the server to 
	allow for isomorphic rendering. It allows you to dynamically load something into a given 
	store that will be needed for the path. To create a service you must also register it in server.js. 
	See the example in server.js of how to register a service. You 
	would also need to create the service as shown in exampleService.js in the services folder.
	Also remember that when creating a new store it must be added to the app.js file.
